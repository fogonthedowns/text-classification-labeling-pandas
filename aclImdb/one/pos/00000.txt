This movie might not be for everyone but I absolutely loved it.... I fell in love with the Characters, the Story, the Scenery and the Actors. Both Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet are brilliant and after watching a few more of Timothee’s films I think he is my most favourite actor of all time which I have never been really decisive about. I think he is so talented especially being so early in his career and no other actor has captured my attention like he has. Anyways back to the movie, the story makes you feel the excitement, happiness, anxiety and pain of a first love no matter if your gay, straight or what ever. Watching the movie I didn’t even question that they were two men, I just loved watching their relationship grow naturally. I think this movie is unique and special though I would love to see a sequel.... I am so engaged in these characters lives I wanna know and be apart of what happens in their future....
