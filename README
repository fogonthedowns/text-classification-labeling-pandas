This example shows how to do text classification starting from raw text (as
a set of text files on disk). We demonstrate the workflow on the IMDB sentiment
classification dataset (unprocessed version). We use the `TextVectorization` layer for
word splitting & indexing.

Sentimate is classified as either positive or negative.

The example is expanded to load the model from disk, if it was already trained.
